# Implementing Blockchain using Python

This project demonstrates a **simple blockchain implementation** in Python with a **Streamlit-based frontend**. The project is designed to help you understand how a blockchain works by providing a basic implementation with an interactive web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Block Structure**: Each block contains data, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash.
- **Blockchain Validation**: Ensures data integrity by linking blocks with hashes.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the blockchain.

│
├── block.py          # Defines the block structure and hash generation
├── blockchain.py     # Manages the blockchain and its operations
├── main.py           # Streamlit application for the frontend
└── __pycache__/      # Auto-generated Python cache files
```

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core blockchain implementation.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend framework for the web interface.

## ⚙️ Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManishhKapal/Implementing-Blockchain-using-Python.git
cd Implementing-Blockchain-using-Python
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application
Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### 5. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to **http://localhost:8501** to access the application.

## ✨ How It Works
1. **Block Creation**:
   - Each block contains:
     - Data (e.g., transaction details).
     - Timestamp.
     - The hash of the previous block.
   - The block structure is defined in `block.py`.

2. **Blockchain Management**:
   - The `blockchain.py` file maintains the chain of blocks.
   - Ensures integrity by validating the chain’s hashes.

3. **Interactive Frontend**:
   - `main.py` serves as the entry point for the Streamlit app.
   - Use the interface to:
     - Add new blocks.
     - View the blockchain with all block details.

---

## 📘 Example Output
After running the application, you can:
- Add blocks by inputting data via the Streamlit interface.
- View the full blockchain, including each block’s:
  - Index.
  - Timestamp.
  - Data.
  - Hash.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add Proof-of-Work (PoW) to simulate mining and difficulty adjustments.
- Implement user authentication for a multi-user blockchain environment.
- Introduce visualization of the blockchain structure.
